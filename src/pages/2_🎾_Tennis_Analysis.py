    This application provides comprehensive analytics on ATP tennis matches, offering insights into historical player performances from 2000 to 2022. It allows users to explore head-to-head matchups between players, view match results, and analyze player performance across different surfaces and tournament rounds.

    - **Data Source:** The dataset contains ATP match results from 2000 to 2022, aggregated from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mneedham/tennis_atp).
    - **Player Search:** Use the search boxes to find specific players and compare their head-to-head records.
    - **Match Analysis:** Analyze past match results, including scores and tournament details, sorted by date.
    - **Surface & Round Breakdown:** Review player performance based on the surface (e.g., grass, clay, hard court) or tournament round.

    This tool is ideal for tennis enthusiasts, analysts, or anyone looking to dive deep into ATP match data and gain insights into player rivalries and trends.
